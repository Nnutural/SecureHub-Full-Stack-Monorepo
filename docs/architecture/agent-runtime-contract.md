# SecureHub Agent Runtime Contract

Version: `v1.1`
Status: frozen for Waves 0-3
Authority: the v1.1 implementation plan dated 2026-07-11

This is the executable contract for `backend/app/runtime/contracts.py`. It
supersedes older descriptions that place QualityCheck inside Harness or allow a
product endpoint to run a Skill directly.

## Authorities

1. `RuntimeEngine` is the only production execution authority. It owns root and
   step lifecycle, scheduling, cancellation, rework, terminal convergence and
   checkpoint recovery.
2. `SecureHubStateMachine` is the only state transition authority.
3. PostgreSQL is the state, lease, checkpoint and audit truth. Redis is only a
   rebuildable wake-up/fan-out projection.
4. `workflow_events` is the only external event truth and transactional outbox.
5. `SkillExecutor` is the only production Skill execution core.
6. `ArtifactRef`, `EvidenceRef` and typed workflow state are the only agent
   collaboration media. Agent free-chat is not a workflow transport.

LangGraph may validate or visualise topology. It may not own run state,
checkpointing, scheduling, recovery or terminal state.

## Fixed Agent And Skill Catalog

Exactly these nine UUIDv5-backed names are enabled:

`policy_interpreter`, `hot_analyst`, `job_analyst`, `competition_advisor`,
`career_planner`, `topic_explorer`, `doc_archivist`, `task_orchestrator`,
`outcome_evaluator`.

The frozen production binding count is 28. `runtime.skill_catalog` derives the
full list from those Agent classes and asserts both the count and UUIDv5 rule.
`_examples/EchoSkill` is not a production binding. Missing, extra, renamed, or
UUID-drifted enabled agents are startup/CI failures.

## Lifecycle

Root states:

```text
queued -> running -> reworking -> running
                 -> pausing -> paused -> queued/running
                 -> waiting_approval -> queued/running
                 -> cancelling -> cancelled
                 -> succeeded | failed | blocked
```

Step attempt states:

```text
pending -> ready -> running -> succeeded | failed | blocked | cancelled
pending/ready -> skipped
```

All transitions require the expected `state_version` and `lease_epoch`. A
terminal root has exactly one terminal event; no token or artifact may be
appended afterwards.

## Execution And Quality

For an accepted Skill call, RuntimeEngine first creates a running step attempt
and running child `agent_runs` record. `SkillExecutor` then performs exactly:

```text
validate -> guardrail -> RetrieverPort -> evidence floor -> evidence snapshot
-> ContextBuilder -> ProviderCallJournal(started) -> ProviderPort
-> strict parse -> output guardrail -> CandidateOutput
```

Real execution is fail-closed. It never substitutes fixture evidence, a fixture
provider, default output fields, an accepted quality result, or a successful
artifact after a failed durable write. Prompt text, secrets, provider reasoning
and full model output are never placed in events or logs.

`QualityCheck` is an explicit `outcome_evaluator.QualityCheck` Workflow node
with its own step attempt and child `agent_runs` record. It consumes a Candidate
Output and EvidenceRefs, returns structured accept/defect data, and routes to
Artifact Saga or bounded deterministic rework. It never runs recursively from
SkillExecutor.

## Capability Categories

| Category | Owner | Examples | Model-selectable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime Port | Runtime / SkillExecutor | Retriever, Provider, RunRecorder, EvidenceSnapshotStore, ProviderCallStore, ArtifactStore, CheckpointStore | No |
| Workflow Action | RuntimeEngine from definition | UpdateProfile, UpdateCapability, PersistLearningPath, PersistGeneratedResource | No |
| Model Tool | ToolRegistry and PolicyEngine | schema-authorised low-risk tools only | Explicit ALLOW/ASK/DENY |

Runtime ports and actions must never be registered as model tools. Production
Agents receive no arbitrary shell, filesystem, or browser tool.

## Modes And Providers

Only `fixture` and `real` modes exist. Fixture is isolated from real persistence
and is only selected explicitly. Real uses true RAG and a real provider; a
fallback is a transparent real-to-real Provider Policy, not a third mode and
never fixture. Root stores requested provider/model; provider calls, child runs
and artifacts store actual provider/model.

Every provider request is journaled before I/O as `started`, then becomes
`completed` with an outcome or `unknown`. A started request after a crash is
unknown unless the upstream result is confirmed. Unknown calls block or await
explicit approved retry, which creates a new attempt. SecureHub does not claim
external-provider exactly-once.

Each stream carries `provider_call_id`, `stream_attempt`, step attempt and event
sequence. After visible tokens, a provider fallback must emit a trace replacement
instruction and start a replacement draft; output from different providers is
never concatenated.

## Events And SSE

The public event vocabulary is exactly:

```text
progress / evidence / token / artifact / trace / done / error
```

`EventEnvelope(workflow_run_id, sequence, event_type, payload)` is the only
serializer contract. Sequence is allocated by atomic increment of
`workflow_runs.next_event_sequence`; `MAX(sequence)+1` is forbidden.

SSE first replays PostgreSQL events after `Last-Event-ID`, then listens to
Redis. A live sequence gap is filled from PostgreSQL before later events are
sent. Duplicate `(run_id, sequence)` is ignored. A disconnect never cancels a
durable run.

## Durable Control Plane

`workflow_runs`, `workflow_step_attempts`, `workflow_events`, checkpoints,
evidence snapshots, provider calls, child `agent_runs` and artifact metadata
are durable. State transition plus event append happens in one transaction.
`workflow_events` is an outbox: a publisher claims unpublished rows with
database locking, emits Redis, then records publication. Publishing may repeat;
fact records do not disappear.

Workers scan PostgreSQL queued/recoverable roots even when Redis is absent.
Claim increments `lease_epoch`; all root, step, checkpoint, retry/rework and
terminal writes compare epoch and state version. A stale worker that updates zero
rows is fenced and stops.

## Artifact Saga And Versioning

Artifact storage statuses are only `staging`, `active`, `orphaned`, `deleted`.
The Saga uploads staging, verifies checksum, commits DB resource metadata, then
activates metadata and makes the artifact event publish-ready. Recovery resumes
staging activation; cleanup tombstones orphaned objects rather than deleting the
audit record.

Every root/checkpoint fixes workflow definition digest, catalog version,
provider policy version, checkpoint schema version and runtime build SHA. Every
skill step also fixes skill version/digest and prompt version/digest. Resume is
`compatible`, explicitly `migratable`, or `incompatible`; it never silently
uses newer workflow/skill/prompt/provider policy.

## API And Ownership

`workflow_runs.id` is the only public root ID. `agent_runs.id` is a child Skill
call only. Start uses `Idempotency-Key`; duplicate start returns the same root.
All query, SSE and controls enforce root ownership. Product endpoints only map
DTO/auth to `WorkflowApplicationService`; they may not import a Skill, create an
async queue/task, generate a random root ID, or inject fixture business data.

## Migration And Rollback

Migrations are additive. A workflow feature flag controls cutover by root, not
random users. During transition `workflow_events` is the only outward event
source. Downgrade is supported for empty/test databases; production rollback
uses forward-compatible code and feature flags, preserving provider-call and
artifact audit history. A stopped worker is replaced through lease expiry and a
new fencing epoch.
